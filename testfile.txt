this is a test file, not even a code

this is the 3rd line of the test file

I'm only adding this for the branch my_branch

now I'm continuing to work on this branch, but I'm not committing yet
RESULT: I can't checkout another branch until I commit this one.

ok, I'm committing
RESULT: I can't directly commit. I have to add this file because it's modified now.

back from branch_from_past, let's see if there's anything different this time
RESULT: turns out I need to re git add this file.. huhhh

do I need to re add if don't leave this branch? I hope not. (past experience said so)
RESULT: YES I DO. Huhhhh... Always add it to staging? interesting
